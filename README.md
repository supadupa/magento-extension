## Features 

* Provides Sauce configuration options for Magento integrations. 
* Adds a new endpoint at `/rest/v1/products/sauce` which provides a custom feed
  for our hotspots feature.
* Adds a custom permission which the product endpoint sits behind.
* Returns the version number in the custom endpoint, so we can always ascertain 
  what version of our application you are using..
* Adds a set of Links in `Marketing > Add Sauce Social > Connection Status /
  Media Library`. Currently these links redirect the user to [our platform](https://github.con/supadupa/sauce)].
